# Solving Programming   
This repository contains solutions to a set of programming problems from specialized programming books, implemented in four different languages:  

- **C++** 🔷  
- **Python** 🐍  

## Sources 📚  
The problems are solved from the following books:  

### 1. Object-Oriented Programming in C++ – Robert Lafore

## Objective 🎯  
This project aims to enhance my understanding of different programming languages, compare techniques used in each language, and improve my problem-solving and algorithm skills.  

## Project Structure 📂  
Each problem has its own folder containing solutions in all four languages. Example structure:  


## How to Use 🛠  
1. Browse the folders to find available problems.  
2. Open the problem description file (if available).  
3. Choose any programming language and run the code.  

## Requirements 📌  
To ensure smooth execution of the solutions, make sure you have the appropriate environment for each language:   
- **C++:** Use GCC or any compiler that supports C++17 or later.  
- **Python:** Python 3.8 or newer.
